# 🏋️ Pandas Exercises and Practice

This file outlines my approach to practicing Pandas through exercises.

---

## 🔗 Source of Exercises

The primary source of Pandas exercises I am currently working through is the excellent [guipsamora/pandas_exercises](https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises/tree/master) repository.

---

## 🎯 My Exercise Strategy

My strategy for tackling these exercises involves:

1.  **Understanding the Problem:** Carefully reading and comprehending the requirements of each exercise.
2.  **Applying Learned Concepts:** Utilizing the Pandas knowledge I've gained to develop a solution.
3.  **Writing Code:** Implementing the solution in Python (code for these solutions is managed in the linked repository).
4.  **Testing and Verification:** Ensuring the code produces the correct output and meets the exercise criteria.

## 📂 Exercise Structure in the External Repository

The [guipsamora/pandas_exercises](https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises/tree/master) repository is organized into different sections based on various Pandas topics. I am working through these sections systematically. To see my progress on specific exercises, please navigate the file structure of that repository.

## 📝 Tracking My Exercise Progress

While the actual code solutions reside in the external repository, I might use this space to:

* Note which exercise sets I have completed.
* Highlight any particularly challenging exercises or key learnings from them.
* Link to specific solution files within the external repository (if I want to draw attention to them).

## 🚀 Next Exercise Focus

My immediate focus is on completing the next set of exercises in the [guipsamora/pandas_exercises](https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises/tree/master) repository, which covers [mention the specific topic if you're on one, e.g., "data cleaning"].

* Back to my main [README.md](../README.md)
* Go to [Pandas Learning Code Overview](../Pandas_Learning/README.md)
