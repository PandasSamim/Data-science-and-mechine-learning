# 📚 Pandas Learning Code Overview

This file provides an overview of my approach to learning Pandas code and where to find the actual implementations.

## 🔗 External Repository for Code and Exercises

My Pandas learning code and solutions to exercises are primarily located in the following external GitHub repository:

[**guipsamora/pandas_exercises Repository**](https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises/tree/master)

## 💡 My Learning Process

My process for learning Pandas involves:

1.  **Studying Concepts:** Reviewing Pandas documentation, tutorials, and examples to understand core functionalities.
2.  **Applying Knowledge:** Implementing code snippets and solutions based on what I learn.
3.  **Practicing with Exercises:** Working through the problems provided in the linked repository to solidify my understanding.

## 📂 Where to Find the Code

As I work through the exercises, the corresponding Python code files (e.g., `.py` or `.ipynb` notebooks) are being managed within the structure of the [guipsamora/pandas_exercises](https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises/tree/master) repository. Please navigate that repository to see the specific code implementations for each exercise.

## 🚀 Examples of Learning Areas

Here are some of the Pandas concepts I am currently learning and applying through code in the external repository:

* Creating and manipulating Series and DataFrames.
* Data selection and indexing techniques (`.loc[]`, `.iloc[]`).
* Reading and writing data from different file formats.
* Handling missing data.
* Data filtering, sorting, and grouping.
* Combining and reshaping DataFrames.
